# Crowd-Sourced Data Collection POC
## Technical Specification & Development Phases

### Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates a decentralized crowd-sourced data collection platform that enables users to easily contribute geo-tagged photos with verifiable metadata. The system leverages blockchain attestations for data integrity, decentralized storage for permanence, and sponsored transactions for seamless user experience.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Zero-friction user onboarding**: Users don't need existing crypto wallets or gas tokens
- **Verifiable data provenance**: All submissions are cryptographically attested with user signatures
- **Permanent storage**: Photos and metadata stored on Arweave for long-term accessibility
- **Transparent data collection**: All attestations are publicly verifiable on-chain
- **True ownership**: Users cryptographically sign their data while enjoying gasless experience

### Technology Stack

**Frontend & User Management:**
- Privy (Account Abstraction & dual wallet generation: EOA + Smart Wallet)
- React/Next.js web application
- Client-side image processing and thumbnail generation

**Blockchain Infrastructure:**
- Optimism Sepolia (testnet for EAS attestations)
- Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for data verification
- Gas sponsorship via paymaster for seamless transactions

**Decentralized Storage:**
- Arweave (devnet) for permanent photo storage
- Irys for simplified Arweave uploads with client-side signing and server funding

**Backend Services:**
- Node.js server for thumbnail storage and API endpoints
- Irys auto-approval system for seamless user authorization
- Simple database for basic data persistence

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **User Onboarding**: Privy generates dual wallets (EOA + Smart Wallet)
2. **Auto-Approval**: System automatically approves Privy users for Irys uploads
3. **Content Capture**: User selects photo (any size)
4. **Preview Generation**: App generates thumbnail for fast interface display
5. **Metadata Extraction**: App extracts metadata from original photo (timestamp, GPS coordinates)
6. **User Review**: User confirms photo and metadata before submission
7. **Dual-Wallet Signing**: 
   - **EOA Wallet**: User signs Arweave upload transaction for data ownership
   - **Smart Wallet**: Creates sponsored EAS attestation via paymaster
8. **Arweave Upload**: Server-funded Irys node processes client-signed transaction
9. **Thumbnail Storage**: Server stores thumbnail locally for fast access
10. **EAS Attestation**: Smart wallet creates sponsored on-chain record linking metadata to Arweave TX ID
11. **Verification**: Data becomes publicly verifiable and queryable

### Captured Data Schema

**EAS Attestation Fields:**
- `photoTakenDate`: ISO timestamp from EXIF data
- `coordinates`: GPS coordinates as array [latitude, longitude] (decimal degrees)
- `arweaveTxId`: Permanent storage reference for photo
- `thumbnailHash`: Client-generated thumbnail identifier
- `userEOA`: EOA address that signed the Arweave upload (for provenance)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dual Wallet Architecture
- **EOA Wallet (Data Signing)**: Used for signing Arweave uploads to establish data ownership and provenance
- **Smart Wallet (Transaction Sponsorship)**: Used for gas-sponsored EAS attestations via paymaster
- **Seamless UX**: Users interact with single interface, system handles wallet switching automatically

### Gas Sponsorship Strategy
- **Arweave Uploads**: Client EOA signs upload transactions; server-funded Irys node pays storage costs
- **EAS Attestations**: Smart wallet creates sponsored transactions via paymaster integration
- **Auto-Approval**: Irys delegation system automatically approves Privy users for uploads
- **Budget Management**: Monitor both Irys funding and paymaster balance levels

### Backend Services (Node.js)

**Core Functions:**
- **Irys auto-approval management** for Privy users
- **Dual wallet coordination** between EOA and Smart Wallet transactions
- **Thumbnail storage and serving** from client-generated thumbnails
- Data validation and sanitization
- EAS attestation formatting and submission
- Arweave TX monitoring and confirmation

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /api/irys/auto-approve  - Auto-approve Privy users for Irys uploads
GET  /api/user/approval      - Check user approval status
POST /upload/prepare         - Validate submission data and metadata
POST /upload/arweave         - Process client-signed Arweave transaction
POST /upload/eas             - Create sponsored EAS attestation
POST /thumbnail/store        - Store client-generated thumbnail
GET  /thumbnail/{id}         - Retrieve stored thumbnail
GET  /data/{txId}           - Retrieve specific submission details
GET  /health                - System health check
```

### Auto-Approval Implementation
- **Trigger**: Automatic upon successful Privy authentication
- **Irys Delegation**: Creates delegation allowing user to upload via server-funded node
- **No Limits**: Open delegation for POC (limits can be added later)
- **Revocable**: System can revoke approvals if needed

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Dual wallet failures**: Fallback mechanisms for each wallet type
- Failed Arweave uploads: Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- EAS attestation failures: Queue system for retry attempts
- **Auto-approval failures**: Retry logic for Irys delegation creation
- Network issues: Graceful degradation with user feedback

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for all uploaded files
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Metadata sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- **Dual wallet security**: EOA for data signing, Smart Wallet for sponsored transactions
- **Auto-approval controls**: Irys delegation system prevents unauthorized access
- **Audit logging**: Track all approval, upload, and attestation activities
